Scoring Script for Database Analysis
This Python script scoring_script.py is designed to fetch data from a MySQL database, process it, and calculate a scoring metric based on recent data. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Setup Database Connection:

The script uses pymysql and sqlalchemy to connect to a MySQL database. You need to provide your database host, username, password, and database name for the connection.
Retrieve Recent Data:

It fetches data from a specified table (tabla_datos) where the date is within the last year from the current date. This is achieved using SQL queries executed through pandas and sqlalchemy.
Data Processing and Scoring:

Once the data is fetched into a pandas DataFrame (df), you can implement your custom logic to process the data and calculate a scoring metric. This part would typically involve data manipulation, calculations, and applying business rules specific to your scoring requirements.
Execution Control with if __name__ == "__main__"::

This block ensures that the main logic (main() function) executes only when you run this script directly (python scoring_script.py). It prevents the code from running if the script is imported as a module into another script.
Customization:

You can extend the script by adding more data processing steps, integrating machine learning models for scoring, or exporting results to other formats or databases as needed.
Usage
To use this script:

Ensure you have Python installed along with required libraries (pymysql, sqlalchemy, pandas).
Update the database connection details (host, user, password, database) in the script.
Run the script using python scoring_script.py in your terminal or command prompt.
